Face Squisher Meta App

Pinching creates a splash effect. The basic idea was to squish peoples heads as a gag, but the hand tracking is still a bit wonky, so the position isn't very accurate.

I just borrowed the splash effect from Unity's 2D Demo, so it's a bit more like a splash in the London river than a head explosion.
